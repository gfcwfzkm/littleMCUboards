# littleMCUboards
A collection of my little dev boards, that I develop and make to explore a new controller. These little microcontroller boards are made to fit into a specific socket of a main-devboard system, at which additional peripherals (Displays, Buttons & Switches, LED-Boards etc.) can be connected to.

The latest and future mcu boards feature a USB-C port for power and self-programming capabilities, either via a bootloader and a USB-to-Serial converter, or straight to the controller's USB-Ports. Also feature the pins brought out for a JTAG, SWD or other kind of programmer.

With this these boards themself can be used alone without the main-devboard system. Old boards that miss that will be uploaded in the /legacy/ folder.

Boards will be uploaded in the following days, so stay tuned!
